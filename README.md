# MoTime

MoTime is a time tracking application that integrates Timing.app data with Moco.

## Current State

The application currently supports:
- Direct SQLite database integration with Timing.app
- Aggregated view of app activities and manual tasks
- Automatic project hierarchy detection and formatting
- Smart project and task matching between Timing and Moco
- Detailed activity information including:
  - App usage statistics
  - Activity counts
  - Task descriptions and notes
  - Duration in various formats

## Features

### Data Collection
- Reads directly from Timing.app's SQLite database
- Aggregates app activities by project and date
- Includes manual tasks with their descriptions
- Maintains project hierarchy information

### Data Processing
- Converts project paths to Moco-compatible format (e.g., "CLI > Project Name" â†’ "[CLI] Project Name")
- Aggregates multiple activities into daily summaries
- Provides both raw seconds and formatted durations
- Tracks activity counts and used applications

### User Interface
- Daily grouping of time entries
- Distinction between app activities and manual tasks
- Detailed activity information display
- Project and task selection with auto-matching
- One-click transfer to Moco

## Setup

1. Clone and install:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/a-und-b/motime.git
   cd motime
   npm install
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables:
   ```
   PORT=3000
   MOCO_DOMAIN=your_moco_domain
   MOCO_API_KEY=your_moco_api_key
   NODE_ENV=development
   TIMING_DB_PATH="/path/to/Timing.app/SQLite.db"
   TIMING_DAYS_BACK=30
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start both the backend server and the frontend development server.

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to view the application.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Start both frontend and backend in development mode
- `npm run server`: Start only the backend server
- `npm run client`: Start only the frontend development server
- `npm run build`: Build the frontend for production

## Features

- View Timing entries
- Select Moco projects and tasks for each entry
- Transfer time entries from Timing to Moco
- Basic error handling and logging

## TODO

- Implement automatic task mapping
- Add time period selection 
- Improve error handling and user feedback
- Improve UI/UX
- Implement unit and integration tests
- Implement persistent storage for transferred entries
- Add filtering and sorting options for time entries
- Optimize performance for larger datasets
- Add more detailed reporting and analytics features
- Add user authentication and authorization
